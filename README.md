# Introduction

Welcome to the Scale API ðŸ‘‹  

This guide provides all of the information needed to get started building an integration to Scale. 

The Scale API is organised around REST. Our API uses standard HTTP verbs and response codes, uses API keys for authentication, returns JSON-encoded responses, and has predictable resource-oriented URLs.
